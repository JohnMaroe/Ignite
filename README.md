# Ignite

### Front-end Bootcamp <br />
Rocketseat's bootcamp is one of the biggest in all Latin America and inspires countless of developers to grow beyond their current level. <br />
It is a step foward in my learning path being part of the first evolution of their bootcamp called Ignite. 💜<br />
The course mainly focus on Front-end, it's fundmentals and uses technologies such as React and NextJS. <br />
Alongside that students have access to videos explaining soft-skills concepts and be part of cases that forces the individual to think by themselves in specific situations. <br />
<br />
While also having access to a huge community where developers can interact and share experiences and of course, study together. <br />

This repository contains all applications made for the purpose of explaining concepts along the way. <br />
Challenges created during the bootcamp can be found on other repositories. <br />
